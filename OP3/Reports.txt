As from the beginning of the 3rd Blok I have watched some videos on(Android studio, SQL, C#, GIT and GITHUB)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday 08 - 02 - 2019: I have studied the first lecture of ANAL 2 (object oriented programming) and searched more on that 
subject, and I have installed SQL on my laptob and watched a tutorial from an Iraqi guy that explains SQL very well:

Saturday 09 - 02 - 2019: I have created my onedrive school acount and used it to save photos from my phone, and Nasr advised 
me to install windows 10 pro, sothat I can use Linux on it
and he advised me to study sharepoint and power BI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday 10 - 02 - 2019 : I have studied the first lecture of DEV3 (Typechecker in C#), and I have created the Report folder in 
PO3 folder on my device and started to report everything I do that is connected to my study.
changed the Grandeomega password to my new official password ending with *

Monday 11 - 02 - 2019 (Beginning of WEEK1)**********:
- Basic search of what fractions are (python documents)
ANALYSE:
- started with learning OOP (object orianted programming)
- Objects can be found everywhere, person, mobile, house, computer, bag, watch.
- Wrote a program to get and set time, used a class, and got to know what __init__ is.
- now I know what is the difference between functions and classes and that classes can
 give more attributes to objects and 
that using a class we can let different objects comunicate with eachother.
- learned that objects must be created inside the class.
- encountered the problem of indentation and the teacher helped me to solve it. 
- when we model a camel class for example, we can have two objects, a camel in the zoo, 
and a camel that can be used for transportation, they both have same attributes but the second object 
has more attributes, the advantage of this class is that use the first objects attributes
 and modify them to the second object. so you can use attributes from the first camel 
and adjust them on the second camel.
DEVELOPMENT:
- when naming a variable in C# , we can use the type TUPLE. example :
(string , int) p = ("Ahmad", 25)
- Item is the argument inside the tuples, so if we have two arguments inside a tuples we say we have item1 and item 2, 
but we can also name the items, we do so by edditing the type:
(string name, int age) p = (Ahmad, 25) 
- in C# we have something called the type checker, so when you assign varible to a type, int for example, you cann't 
assign a string to the same variable because the computer expects an integer.
- When you assign a value to a variable inside an if statement or for/while loop, the variable gets a value, 
when you are outside the statement, you must define assign a type and a value to that variable. 
and it gets a special type in the backend :
	check(<e1 + e2>, T) -----> <E> --------> check (<e1>, T) ------><E>, T ----------> check (<e2>, T) ---------> <E>, T
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 12 - 02 - 2019:
- I began my day with a cancelled train in Utrecht centraal and then there was an accident between Rotterdam and Gouda
so we had to travel first to Den Haag Centraal and then to Rotterdam.
In the train I have made a new file called Opdracht uitleg, it's meant to explain the multiple choice questions of Development.
- I have explaind the first 14 MC questions from grandeomega in the opdracht uitleg.
- I have downloaded visual studio again to use C#
- I have downloaded mono for grandeomega.
- I have downloaded grandeomega again
- created google drive for my new groop (Gijs - Suman - Nils - Conor - Saad) and and we have made a github repository and discord room
- we have chosen for the Techlab Project and as a start we have to make individua interviewschema and we must make the product backlog
 that we will get from Recardo and a sprint backlog, and also the doelgroep**************************************
- for this project we have to work on Java and our API can be done using python
- for the project I have to know : API - python - Java - SQL - Android studio - github and git

KEUZEVAK:
- presentatie geven (week 3)  : Cyperrecht - Cyperlaw -  samen met Cindi (praktijk)
- youtube video : Big data & Big brother
- we chose 3 apps and talked about the possibility that hackers can get our data from them:
google maps: locations  - work place - univercity - school - vacation - transportation
spotify : cultural background - music preference - mental analyse - bed time - wake up time
chrome : hackers can know everything about me if they can get my account, or if my information are stolen
example: religion - sexual preference - relations - political opinions 
- nice idea from the teacher : make different pasword for each account, and it doesn't need to be difficult, you can make
it very simple ! example : Rodetafel** NAME OF THE ACCOUNT 
- I have to read the modulewijzer.

Wednesday 13 - 02 - 2019:
ANALYSE:
-We have made a review on the last lesson and wrote 3 programmes which I saved in the folder ANALYSE3/WEEK1.
-some nice notes:
a nice example of why is the Account number not considered as an ID? look to the car licence, It is the same situation but what 
if you replace the licence to your new car? then is the licence not more an ID! thats why every object has a specia ID
- Important subject: Classes interaction, you can let objects interact with eachother, look to interaction.py
-I have to learn more about __init__ and self.
DEVELOPMENT:
- Today's lesson was the same lesson of last lesson but with different teacher, we've got a second teacher, the Italian one,
 he is very nice and he explains in a very nice way.
- Important notes:
-difficult languages like C# are good for long time preservation because you kill lots of Bugs even before you start running the program.
-A strong programming language is a language that makes it easier to write programmes with less Bugs!
- In C#, what happens between If and Else stays between If and Else!!
don't forget the semi colon at the end!(;)
-the VAR means that you declare a variable without giving it a type and that the value you use for this variable will give him the type!
- the VOID term means that the variables in the Type-Chek process are declared without values.
- In the evening I went the Bib after my meeting with Marianne, and there I studied the Analyse programes, clock, student, and interaction. 
And then I have solved ALL Grandeomega opdrachten behalve one backward, namely BA6, the excersice  was wron. (Not my fout)
-After the gym I went to Utrecht and on my way I read the scope chapter from the lecture reader of week 1 Dev.
-Even thoug you cann't use a variable outside of its scope, you can not even declare it again, because the type checker
doesn't forget that you have declared it once!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 14 - 02 - 2019 :
- I traines on Grandeomega week 1
- I found a website to learn java code examples, and i can train there and answer questions
-I asked Debohra about BA6 and she helped me out, I had to change the type according to the lecture reader,adding (var)
-I have finished all opdrachten van week1.
- Debohra said that we have to read the modulewijzer van Dev3 sothat we can know some tricks. 
-Debohra mentioned 3 differences between Python and C#: 
1 in C# we use this {   and here we write our program, and indentation doesn't matter}
2 in C# we use double qutation " " for string  instead od single qutations '  ' in Python
3 in C# there is an important factor, the Type-Checking... so we have to write the type of the variable before declaring it,
for example: int x = 5 . that is good. But we can not write x = 5 like in Python
-I read a bit of Andrea slides, they liik good, and I will use them in my study
-I made a folder called HERKANSINGEN for DEV2 and ANAL2.
-I made a folder BATTLES, in this folder I will plan a battle every week to review every
week by itself, inclusief the herkansingen.
-I searched for the interviewschema and wrote een verslag over interviewschema, I still need to make an example
over the interviewschema. 
- I wrote an interviewschema example but i still need toe write an interviewschema about doelgroep analyze
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday 15  - 02 - 2019 :
- On the way to Utrecht I have read a bit about groepsdoel and then went to the mosque to sheick Azzedine Karrat.
- After friday prayer I studied a bit about classes and __name == __main .
- I read from Andrije slides on Analyse 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturday 16 - 02 - 2019:
I have installed Java again on my laptop and put it in the right path.
I have installed eclipse but It didnt work
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday 17 - 02 - 2019:
I have made the interviewschema (Het Techlab)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday 18 - 02 - 2019 (Beginning of WEEK2)**********:
-My group and I met at school and we made the sprint backlog for the currnt sprnt and it went
over the layout of our project and and the first basics.
-ANALYSE:
-Today's lesson was over UML unified modeling language:
Static attribute is an attributes that comes out the interaction of two objects attribution, example:
class graduated students, we have two objects student1+student2, but the new attribute is the graduated students.
inheritense: object inherits an attribute from class, example: employee inharets attributes from class person.
a sort of objects is an objects that has onother object inside itself.
I have to learn more about fractions.
I have to learn more about abstract.
private: the book in the library/ Encapsulation
incapsulation is implementetion of abstruction.
important slides: 9 + 13
- In the end of the lesson I downloaded Intellij IDEA Community Edition, in order to write Java programes
DEVELOPMENT:
R f (T1 t1, T2 t2, Tn tn) {
		e
   		} 
in the previews program, e has the same type as R
Func<T1 t1, T2 t2, Tn tn, R>    -----> this is the type of the function, we call it Funk.
control flow:
		P 	 U	  Q
		bool		void--------->	bool
		bool		bool--------->	bool
		void		bool--------->	bool
		void		void--------->	void
-I have to understand the design pattern: functions with one argument that returns another function with one argument.
- I have to understand the then function and what it does.
I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CLOSURE IS.
KEUZEVAK:
I met with Cendy and we discussed about the presentation and we decided to divide the tasks and I will talk about:
1 The opening
2 The definetion of Cyberlaw
3 Cyber crime
4 cyber warfare
5 I have to make questions from my pieces and send them to Cendy sothat she can make a kahoot game.
6 Currying (Iedere keer een argument invulle die functie terug geeft)
